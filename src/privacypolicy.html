<h1>Pattern:Script Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
<h2>If you're playing Pattern:Script games hosted on clementsparrow.github.io</h2>
<p>
	Pattern:Script games accessed at URLs like "<i>clementsparrow.github.io/PuzzleScript/src/play.html?...</i>" are stored on GitHub as <a href="https://gist.github.com">gists</a> and fetched from there with <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">GitHub's Developer API</a>. These games are thus subject to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement/">GitHub's privacy policy</a>.
<p>
	Why do I need to store things there? I need to store games somewhere - I think the sharing functionality is really important for Pattern:script, and makes making + sharing games really easy.
<p>
	If you don't want to use the online-sharing facilities you can still save/load game locally, and can still export standalone html files.
<p>
<h2>If you're creating Pattern:Script games</h2> 
<ul>
	<li>Pattern:Script can save things to your browser's localstorage - it is just used for loading/saving files in the file save dropdown.
	<li>If you share a game, you need to authorize with your <a href="http://github.com">github account</a>.  Then, when you hit SHARE in future, a publicly-accessible copy of your game is uploaded to a <a href="http://github.com">gist</a> in your account.  
	<li>If you "save on cloud" a game, you need to authorize with your <a href="http://github.com">github account</a>.  Then, when you hit SAVE ON CLOUD in future, a private copy of your game is uploaded to a <a href="http://github.com">gist</a> in your account.  It is not publicly anounced and does not appear in search result, but is still available to anybody who knows its URL.
</ul>
