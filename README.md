Pattern:Script
==============

About
-----

*Pattern:Script* is an open-source HTML5 game engine based on [PuzzleScript](https://www.puzzlescript.net). Try it out [here](https://clementsparrow.github.io/Pattern-Script/src/editor.html)!

The manual has not been updated yet from PuzzleScript, as the project targets game devs with prior knowledge of PuzzleScript. A list of the new features (and planned features) is available [on the project's wiki](https://github.com/ClementSparrow/Pattern-Script/wiki) â€“ you should start there to learn what Pattern:Script can do for you!
